## Level 1: Black Friday

_Welcome to "Secure Code Game"! :wave:_

### üìù Storyline

A few days before the massive shopping event Black Friday, an electronics shop without an online presence rushed to create a website to reach a broader customer base. As a result, they spent all their budget on development without investing in security. Do you have what it takes to fix the bug and progress to Level 2?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `solution` provides one working solution. There are several possible solutions.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. You successfully completed the level when both `hack.py` and `tests.py` pass üü¢.
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.js` file.
1. Compare your solution with `solution.py`.

If you need assistance, don't hesitate to ask for help in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game/discussions) or on our [Slack](https://gh.io/securitylabslack), at the [#secure-code-game](https://ghsecuritylab.slack.com/archives/C05DH0PSBEZ) channel.

### üìù Storyline

At the time "The Matrix" was first released in 1999, programming was different. In the movie, a computer programmer named Thomas "Neo" Anderson leads the fight in an underground war against powerful computers who have constructed his entire reality with a system called the Matrix. Do you have what it takes to win that war and progress to Level 3?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.c` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `solution` provides one working solution. There are several possible solutions.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. Keep working inside the same environment as in Level 1
1. If you skipped Level 1, go back and follow the üö¶ **Time to start** guide
1. Review the code in `code.h`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. The level is completed successfully when both `hack.c` and `tests.c` pass. üü¢
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.txt` file.

## Level 3: Social Network

_Nice work finishing Level 2: Matrix! It's now time for Level 3: Social Network. :sparkles:_

### üìù Storyline

The following fictitious story takes place in the mid-2030s. Authorities worldwide have become more digitized. Various governments are adapting social network technology to fight crime. The goal is to establish local communities that foster collaboration by supporting citizens with government-related questions. Other features include profile pictures, hashtags, real-time support in comments, and public tip sharing. Do you have what it takes to secure the social network and progress to Level 4?

### :keyboard: Setup instructions

## Level 4: Data Bank

_Nicely done! Level 3: Social Network is complete. It's time for Level 4: Database. :partying_face:_

By the way, we welcome contributions for new game levels! Learn more [here](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### üìù Storyline

Databases are essential for our applications. However, malicious actors only need one entry point to exploit a database, so defenders must continuously protect all entry points. Can you secure them all?

## Level 5: Locanda

_Almost there! One level to go! :heart:_

### üìù Storyline

It's a common myth that passwords should be complex. In reality, it's more important that passwords are long. Some people choose phrases as their passwords. Users should avoid common expressions from movies, books, or songs to safeguard against dictionary attacks. Your password may be strong, but for this exercise, a website you have registered with has made a fatal but quite common mistake. Can you spot and fix the bug? Good luck!
